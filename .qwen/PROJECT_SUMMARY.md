# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a comprehensive documentation for a Docker-based microservices tracing demo project that showcases OpenTelemetry instrumentation with Python (Flask/FastAPI) and Go services, along with full observability stack including Grafana, Jaeger, Prometheus, Tempo, Loki, and Pyrra.

## Key Knowledge
- The project demonstrates distributed tracing, metrics, and logs collection using OpenTelemetry
- Services include:
  - flask-app (Python/Flask with auto-instrumentation)
  - fastapi-app (Python/FastAPI with manual instrumentation)
  - golang-app (Go with eBPF instrumentation via Beyla)
  - postgres-db (PostgreSQL database)
- Observability stack:
  - Grafana for visualization
  - Jaeger and Tempo for traces
  - Prometheus for metrics
  - Loki for logs
  - Pyroscope for profiling
  - Pyrra for SLO management
- Main scenarios involve inter-service communication tracing and load testing with k6
- All services are containerized and orchestrated with Docker Compose

## Recent Actions
- Created comprehensive QWEN.md documentation file with:
  - Project description and architecture overview
  - Detailed component descriptions
  - Three usage scenarios with Mermaid diagrams
  - Grafana dashboards information
- Enhanced README.md with HTML-formatted images and descriptions
- Added detailed information about:
  - Flask-FastAPI interaction scenario
  - Flask-Go interaction scenario
  - k6 load testing scenario
  - Grafana dashboard capabilities
- Created detailed README.md files for each service:
  - FastAPI app with descriptions of all Python files and their functionalities
  - Flask app with information about automatic instrumentation
  - Golang app with details about eBPF instrumentation via Beyla
